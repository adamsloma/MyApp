# Vite + Ionic = ðŸ’œðŸ’šðŸ’™
Develop Ionic/Vue apps using Vue 3, Vite, JS, Capacitor, and the Ionic framework, inspired by [this blog post](https://dev.to/aaronksaunders/getting-started-with-vitejs-ionic-framework-beta-v6-and-vuejs-2o8l).

## Notes about Usage/Workflow
* Rather than building with `ionic build`, use `npm run build` to use Vite to compile a production build to the `dist` folder. 
* After installing the Capacitor CLI you can use commands such as `npx cap sync ios` like normal.
